My name is Philip T. Patton (Phil, @philpatton). Iʻm a graduate research assistant with Lars Bejder at the [Marine Mammal Research Program](https://www.mmrphawaii.org/) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. Also, I'm a [NOAA QUEST Fellow](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/content/quantitative-ecology-and-socioeconomics-training-quest-program), meaning that also work with the [Cetacean Research Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/about-us/whale-and-dolphin-surveys-pacific-islands) at the [Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center). 

Currently, I research ways to improve population assessments of toothed whales that live in the Main Hawaiian Islands. This includes [automating photo-identification](https://github.com/philpatton/multispecies-photoid) of these animals, understanding how these automated tools [interact with capture-recapture models](https://github.com/philpatton/autocapture), and estimating demographic parameters using cutting edge methods in capture recapture.

I did my master's research with [Krishna Pacifici](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/directory/krishna-pacifici/) at North Carolina State University, where I studied ways to improve estimates of species distribution, aka where we find species, particularly when species interact and when the data contains sampling errors. The [cowbird](https://github.com/philpatton/cowbird) repository shows one way to analyze these data when species interact. 

Please feel free to email me, pattonp@hawaii.edu, if you would like to get in touch.

Thanks for looking!
