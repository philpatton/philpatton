My name is Philip T. Patton (Phil, @philpatton). Iʻm a graduate research assistant in the [Marine Mammal Research Program](https://www.mmrphawaii.org/) at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. I'm also a [NOAA QUEST Fellow](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/content/quantitative-ecology-and-socioeconomics-training-quest-program), meaning that I'm also advised by the [Cetacean Research Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/about-us/whale-and-dolphin-surveys-pacific-islands) at the [Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center). 

Currently, I research ways to improve population assessments of whales that live around the Main Hawaiian Islands. Specifically, Iʻm working to improve our data pipeline such that we are better able to translate messy photos into usable data. 

To that end, Iʻm developing deep learning algorithms that identify individual whales, and possibly estimate volume, from a large database of whale photos.

I did my master's research with [Krishna Pacifici](https://faculty.cnr.ncsu.edu/krishnapacifici/people/) at North Carolina State University, where I studied ways to improve estimates of species distribution, aka where we find species, particularly when species interact and when the data contains sampling errors. The [cowbird](https://github.com/philpatton/cowbird) repository shows one way to analyze these data when species interact. 

Iʻm always looking for potential collaborators! Please feel free to email me, pattonp@hawaii.edu, or dm me on twitter, @philidota.

Thanks for looking!
